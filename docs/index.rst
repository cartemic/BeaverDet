For when you want the detonations to stay on the inside.

This package was made to help with the design of a closed-end detonation tube,
and was written as part of my PhD research in the
`propulsion lab <http://research.engr.oregonstate.edu/blunckgroup/propulsion-laboratory>`_
at Oregon Sate University.
