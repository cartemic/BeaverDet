# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: Documentation

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master, ppf_sphinx ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
    # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    # nbsphinx needs pandoc
    - uses: r-lib/actions/setup-pandoc@v1

    # I hacked this together. If you separate the conda stuff into a different
    # step it does stupid, stupid things with your conda envs. Don't do it. No.
    # Unfortunately sphinx-action doesn't seem to like nbsphinx, so I'm striking
    # out on my own here. I am a noob. If any of this looks dumb, that's likely
    # why.
