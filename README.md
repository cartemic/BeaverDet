This package was made to help with the design of a closed-end detonation tube, and was written as part of my PhD research in the [propulsion lab](http://research.engr.oregonstate.edu/blunckgroup/propulsion-laboratory) at Oregon Sate University.

Feel free to shoot me an [email](mailto:cartemic@oregonstate.edu) with any questions or issues.
