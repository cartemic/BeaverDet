# Introduction

A detonation is a supersonic combustion reaction in which a reaction front is coupled with a pressure shock front. Adiabatic heating from the shocks helps sustain the combustion front, which in turn accelerates the shock front. Because the products of a detonation are at a higher pressure than the reactants, thermodynamic cycles using detonations (such as the Humphrey cycle) have the potential for higher thermodynamic efficiency than deflagration-based cycles (such as the Brayton cycle) @Coleman2001

# Statement of need 

In order to study the structure of gaseous detonations, a closed-end detonation tube is required. The design of a detonation tube requires many considerations, including estimation of the required length for deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT), tube material and size selection (including the effects of transient pressures), fastener failure calculations (including bolt pull-out), flange class selection, viewing window sizing (if optical access is required), and prediction of safe operating conditions (including accounting for detonation reflection). All of this is specific to the mixture being detonated, therefore it is important to be able to quickly re-run the analysis for new mixtures. ``pypbomb`` combines tools for all of these needs in one easy-to-use package.

# Summary

that's a neato what now right

* cite sdt :)
* mention ongoing research projects and anticipated publications etc

Pypbomb contains a series of tools that can be used to quickly design and find the operational envelope of a closed-end detonation tube. 

* uses cantera and sdtoolbox
* dynamic load factor from beltman and shepherd
* DDT runup from ciccarelli and dorofeev
